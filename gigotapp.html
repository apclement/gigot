<div class='body'>Someone pointed out below the [somewhat unfair] comparison of time based on using Subversion using the http
protocol. Actually, there is something else that (IMHO) is misleading. In Subversion, if you're disconnected from the Internet, you can
still do "svn [add|remove|etc.]". Only when you want to do a commit do you need an Internet connection. So, you can be away from the
Internet and do heaps of adds, removes, etc. Likewise, you can do an "add" and then "remove" without doing a commit -- the net effect is
that what you wanted to add was never added. While I get the point that with git, you have a copy of the repository, in the end, if you are
away from the office and don't have an Internet connection and your computer dies, you also lost everything. I mean, if you know what
happens behind the scenes of git and Subversion, I can see git has advantages; but if you think about it as "is my work safely put away?" or
"can others see my work?", then the answer has nothing to do with Subversion or git -- it has more to do with whether you're connected to
the Internet.
